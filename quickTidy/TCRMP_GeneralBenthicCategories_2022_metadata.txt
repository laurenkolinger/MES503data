ADDITIONAL INFORMATION & REMARKS
------------------------
- Benthic transects are the same ones on which coral health metrics are recorded. Each is 10m in length and there are typically 6 per site though additional transects may have been recorded. All transects are filmed on the left side and videos are clipped into consecutive non-overlapping still images for analysis
- Coral Point Count with Excel Extensions (CPCe) software (see Kohler and Gill 2006) was used for analysis through 2018 after which random point assignment was done using R Studio
- The number of points per image has varied throughout the course of the monitoring program dependent on the camera system used: 10 (2001 - 2011), 15 (2012 - 2013), and 20 (2014 - pres)
- Rhodolith (RO) was added as a benthic cover category in 2011
- Peyssonnelia sp (PEY) was added as a benthic cover category in 2014
- Ramicrusta sp (RAMI) was added as a benthic cover category in 2017
- Data in red indicates that values were unable to be verified during QAQC because the original analysis file was missing or had been corrupted
- Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD) was added as a coral condition category after its arrival in the US Virgin Islands in 2019
- Cells containing "ND" indicate that there is no data recorded for that benthic category
